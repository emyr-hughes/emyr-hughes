https://emyr-hughes.web.app 
This basically functions as a web/online CV, albeit still a work in progress, it started out as a testing ground for `react-native-web` and I ended up making a few components and decided to use it as somewhere I can showcase some of the components I've made! PS. Try out snake

https://shop.spicybois.co.uk 
This is a website I created for a friend who started a company selling beef jerky, this was also created using `react-native-web`, with firebase and google cloud functions working as a back end, and integration with stripe to manage payments. PS. No products are currently for sale, but will be back soon!
